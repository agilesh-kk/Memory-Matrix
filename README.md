# Memory-Matrix
 As a beginner in full-stack development, I’ve just completed a fun and challenging mini project where I created a Memory Card Matching Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This project was made with the help of VS Code for Education and introduced me to:

🖥️ Building interactive web applications
🔄 Programming fundamentals like loops, conditions, and functions
🎨 Styling with CSS and manipulating user interactions with JavaScript

### Additionals ###
In order to run the project paste the 'style.cc' file in styles folder and 'script.js' in scripts folder.
